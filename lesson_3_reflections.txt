When would you want to create a remote repository rather than  keeping all your work local?
When I want to work with other people or switching to other computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It's because sometimes it may have broken code on the GitHub that we don't want to pull it before it's fixed.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork: It is a GitHub version's clone just on the GitHub to GitHub
When I want to develop other's people project.
clones: It's GitHub to local or local to local.
when I switched PC, and I want to keep doing the stuffs.
branches: It's making other develop line.
when I work in a team, I work on other feature first and we will combine it into 1 project in the future.
